##What is a 'centile'?
A 'centile' is short for 'percentile'. We'll explain a bit more of that later. Centiles are a way of comparing your child's height and weight against the range of normal values for children, in order to detect problems with growth. The 50th centile represents the exact middle of the normal range, the 0th centile is the lowest in the range, and the 100th centile the highest. To illustrate what we *mean* by a centile, let's use an example: If a child's height is at the 9th centile, then it means that 9% of children *at exactly that age* weigh less than them, and 91% *at exactly that age* weigh more than them. So we can see that this child is towards the lower end of the height range for their age, but it's still within the normal range.

##What are centiles for?
Kids come in all shapes and sizes and their growth rate varies a lot as they grow, this can make it hard to detect abnormal growth patterns. The original paper/card centile charts were originally to help doctors detect babies who aren't putting on weight, malnourished children and those with unusually small stature (height) - who would then be investigated to find the cause. These days they are still used for the same purposes, although we also now use them to help monitor overweight children.

##When is a centile 'abnormal'?
There isn't really any such thing as an 'abnormal' centile, and a single reading is not always helpful. Centiles can alert us to abnormal growth patterns over weeks and months. If you think your child's centile readings might be abnormal then it's recommended to discuss this with your health visitor or GP.
