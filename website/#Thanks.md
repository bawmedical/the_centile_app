#Thanks and Acknowledgements

First and foremost we would like to extend our thanks to the Medical Research Council and in particular Professor Tim Cook for allowing openGPSoC to have a licence to use the UK90 LMS tables in the_centile_app

Other thanks, in no particular order:

* Jade Onakunle and Santa Eglite at the MRC, with whom we communicated while organising the licence - thanks, you made the process very straightforward
* NHS Hack Day and its fantastic community
