* Professor Tim Cole (https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=TCOLE39) who originally developed the LMS tables
* the Medical Research Council (http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm), whom are the copyright owners of the UK90 LMS Tables and who very kindly have provided us with a free license to use them for non-profit purposes in an open source app.
* the Centers for Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov/), who openly publish their LMS tables and formulae (http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/percentile_data_files.htm), which gave us an advance test-bed for building the Python centile engine, and gave us some important pointers as to how to do the conversion from measurement to centile.
